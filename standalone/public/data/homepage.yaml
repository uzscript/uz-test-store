      comment: "Contacted about scripts and was very nice and talked about wanting to meet the needs of the customer and what we like. I appreciate when I purchase something that the developer does this I know it can be hard todo so its nice to see when the developer takes the extra step. As for the future I hope the see the scripts more editable when needed for different situations / servers."

      comment: "Well, it was interesting at first installing the Character system on QBox but sure enough the entire thing got an update to support QBox to fix the issues myself and possibly others were facing. 10/10 support and hands down to the developers for putting in the work asap. Thank you to the team for making this happen. Would recommend"
